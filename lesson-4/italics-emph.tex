\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
Some text with \emph{emphasis and \emph{nested} content}.
% \emph toggles between whatever styling we choose for it (undoes italics when everything is italics, and vice versa); so \emph is better for nesting
% in presentations, \emph can be used to change color, for example, so it doesn't have to be italics.
% so in this way, \emph is better than \textit as we can change it later to be an alias for another command such as boldface

Some text in \textit{italic and \textit{nested} content}.
% \textit makes everything italicized, even if its nested.
